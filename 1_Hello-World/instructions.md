## 1: Hello, World!

We are somewhat old school in WA2. We will always begin our exploration of new
programming languages with a "Hello, World!" program. Here, `index.html` has a
`<h1>` tag that's empty. We want to fill it using JavaScript.

There are issues in the JS and in the HTML impeding our progress.

## BONUS ROUND

See if you can modify the JS to use only two lines. Maybe look up *chained functions*...

## MEGA BONUS ROUND

See if you can use `document.createTextNode()` and `element.appendChild()` to
accomplish the same tasks.
