# 3: Strong Foundations
Our HTML so far has been a little...ugly. I'm just gonna say it. It's ugly. It's layout only a mother could love. So we need to give this markup a makeover.

## CSS
**Cascading Style Sheets** are how we make our HTML look good. By linking CSS to HTML, we can create appearance rules for elements, classes, and even individual IDs.

## CSS Frameworks
The amount of CSS required to make a modern-looking website can be daunting. Also, most of the work of creating this CSS from scratch is repetitive since so many others have already done this for us.

We will stand on the shoulders of CSS giants.

One very popular CSS framework is [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is great, but in a little bit of flux right now. Instead, we will use [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). The source code has been included in this file. We'll use it for our responsive homepage.

Take a moment to check out the Foundation documentation before jumping into the objectives.

## Mustang Apps, Inc.
We're going to make a homepage for our app development firm. Of course we'll eventually need a logo and some images, but we also have some basic website essentials like a nav, intro sections, etc. And of course, we need to make the site *responsive*â€”resizeable for mobile devices.

## Primary Objective
Use the Foundation classes to get this homepage looking right. There's more than one right answer to this assignment, so long as the site responds well and looks good.

One thing we'll need for sure is to clean up that nav. Look i1n the documentation for a nav bar.

## Secondary Objectives
### Oooh, pretty pictures!
The named divs could use some image love. We could also maybe use a slider for "hero pictures" up above the named divs.

### Add some style
Use `main.css` to add some custom styles. As a recommendation, maybe a custom color for the headers in the named divs?
